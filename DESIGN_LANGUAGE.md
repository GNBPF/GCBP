# GCBP — Design Language System

## 1. Core Philosophy
**"Institutional Authority meets Human Impact."**

The design of the Global Collective for Better Planet (GCBP) website is built to communicate credibility, scale, and long-term seriousness. It eschews startup trends and "flashy" tech visuals in favor of a grounded, editorial aesthetic reminiscent of high-level policy reports and global institutions.

*   **Keywords:** Serious, Thoughtful, Global, Dense.
*   **Vibe:** A digital annual report that lives and breathes.
*   **Goal:** When a user finishes scrolling, they should feel: *"This foundation is built for long-term impact."*

## 2. Typography
The type system pairs classical authority with modern clarity.

### Primary (Headlines): **Playfair Display**
*   **Role:** Carries the voice of the institution. Used for section titles, hero statements, and impact numbers.
*   **Why:** Its high-contrast serif strokes evoke history, journalism, and established trust. It provides the "editorial" weight necessary for a global foundation.

### Secondary (Body & UI): **DM Sans**
*   **Role:** Delivers the data. Used for navigation, body copy, tags, and captions.
*   **Why:** A geometric sans-serif that is highly legible at small sizes, ensuring complex policy information remains accessible and inclusive.

## 3. Color Palette
A strict, purpose-driven system designed to distinguish GCBP from generic tech platforms.

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Navy** | ![#0F2C4C](https://placehold.co/15x15/0F2C4C/0F2C4C.png) | `#0F2C4C` | The foundation. Deep, serious. Used for Hero and Impact backgrounds. |
| **Action Blue** | ![#005EB8](https://placehold.co/15x15/005EB8/005EB8.png) | `#005EB8` | The active voice. UN-style reference. Used for primary links. |
| **Growth Green** | ![#2E5C38](https://placehold.co/15x15/2E5C38/2E5C38.png) | `#2E5C38` | The mission. Used for "Donate" buttons and environmental accents. |
| **Warm Sand** | ![#F7F5F2](https://placehold.co/15x15/F7F5F2/F7F5F2.png) | `#F7F5F2` | The canvas. Replaces clinical white to feel more organic and "paper-like." |
| **SDG Gold** | ![#FFB81C](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFB81C/FFB81C.png) | `#FFB81C` | The highlight. Used for statistics and key emphasis. |

## 4. Visuals & Texture

### Atmospheric Video
*   **Style:** Abstract, slow-moving loops (e.g., deep ocean currents, light caustics).
*   **Treatment:** Overlaid with `mix-blend-multiply` gradients and a subtle blur (3px) to ensure text legibility and create a mood of depth.

### Photography
*   **Subject:** "On-the-ground" reportage. Community meetings, reforestation efforts.
*   **Treatment:** Authentic lighting, high fidelity. Avoids staged stock photography clichés.

### Texture
*   **Paper Grain:** A subtle noise/paper texture is applied to the CTA section to give a tactile, printed-matter feel to the final call to action.

## 5. Layout & Spacing
*   **High Density:** The layout was refined to reduce excessive whitespace ("batting"), favoring a denser, more information-rich structure typical of NGO reports.
*   **Editorial Grids:** Asymmetrical layouts (e.g., the Mission section) break the monotony of standard blocks.
*   **Divider Lines:** Thin, 1px borders are used to separate content cleanly without adding visual bulk.

---

## 6. Motion Principles
Animations are engineered, not decorative.

*   **Speed:** Slow and deliberate (0.6s - 0.8s durations).
*   **Easing:** Smooth, non-elastic. No bounces.
*   **Types:** 
    *   **Fade In + Slide Up:** Used for text entry to simulate reading flow.
    *   **Counting:** Used for impact metrics to show data accumulation.
*   **Rule:** Animation must never delay the reading experience. It serves to establish a pace of "slow reading."
